# Odin Project - Knights Travails

This is my implementation of Knights Travails using recursive BFS. It does what it should. It is probably not as efficient as it could be, but I'm still happy with figuring out the "output the full path" part.

## Features

- Support for larger board sizes by implementing the BOARD_SIZE constant

- Improved performance through an efficient management of the BFS queue
